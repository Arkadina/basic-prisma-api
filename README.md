# basic api prisma

I recreated <a href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/typescript/rest-express">this repository</a>, which serves as a basic example of an API using Prisma.io. I made several modifications and added comments throughout the project, so it is somewhat different.
